  ## 🦺 How use the app
- Project created with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.
- Run `ng serve` to start a dev server. 
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate new components. 
- It is also possible to use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
- Run `ng build` to build the project, with artifacts stored in the `dist/` directory.
- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests with a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
- Use `ng help` to get more help on the Angular CLI, or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account.
- Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.
- Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following additional features:
    1. A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view , where details about the director of that particular movie will be displayed.
    1. A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view , where details about that particular genre of the movie will be displayed.

## 👨‍💻 User Stories
